Eager to learn and grow, I am deeply passionate about data analytics and am wholeheartedly committed to developing both my academic knowledge and practical skills in this field.\nThis summer, I gained invaluable hands-on experience through an internship at Genpact. There, I’ve had the privilege to work on real-world data science projects, applying the theories and concepts I’ve learned in the classroom.\nI look forward to further expanding my knowledge and skill set in data science as I continue my academic journey. I’m always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, professionals, and mentors in the field. Whether it’s sharing insights, collaborating on projects, or exploring new opportunities, I believe in the power of networking to drive growth and innovation."
